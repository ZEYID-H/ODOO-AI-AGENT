# Odoo Business Intelligence Assistant

**A read-only, AI-powered Business Intelligence assistant for Odoo ERP.**
Ask business questions in plain English — customer health, product performance,
collections priority, sales trends, executive KPIs — and get back accurate,
formatted answers sourced live from Odoo. The assistant can **read** your ERP
data at any depth; it is **structurally incapable of changing it**.

---

## The Problem

Getting a straight answer out of an ERP usually means: know which module to
open, know which filter to apply, know which report to run, and still end up
exporting to Excel to actually answer the question ("who owes us the most
money and for how long?", "is one product too large a share of our revenue?").
Non-technical stakeholders — managers, collections staff, owners — either wait
on someone else to pull the report, or don't ask the question at all.

This project closes that gap: a natural-language interface in front of live
Odoo data, purpose-built for **business analysts and managers**, not
developers — with a security model that lets it be handed to anyone without
risking a single write to production data.

---

## Architecture

**Two front doors, one unchanged core.** The original Streamlit prototype
and a newer Next.js + FastAPI SaaS stack both run against the exact same
Python business logic — neither duplicates a single tool, formatter, or
security rule. Pick whichever UI you want; both answer identically because
both ultimately call the same function.

**Layer by layer:**

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Streamlit UI** (`app.py`) | Chat interface, Executive Dashboard, quick-question buttons, statement export downloads. Presentation only — no business logic. Calls `route_query()` in-process. |
| **Next.js UI** (`apps/web`) | Login-gated chat interface with persistent, per-user conversation history. Presentation + auth + conversation storage only — no business logic, no direct Odoo access. Calls the FastAPI backend over HTTP. See the *SaaS Stack* installation section below. |
| **FastAPI backend** (`apps/api`) | Thin HTTP wrapper around `route_query()` for `apps/web` — translates HTTP requests to the same function call the Streamlit app makes in-process. No business logic of its own. See [`docs/API_CONTRACT.md`](docs/API_CONTRACT.md). |
| **LLM** (`src/services/openai_service.py`) | Sends the question + tool schemas to OpenAI. The model selects a tool and extracts arguments (e.g. `get_customer_balance(customer_name="Apple Mart")`); it never touches Odoo directly. |
| **Router** (`src/agent/router.py`) | The single entry point (`route_query`), used identically by both front ends. Tries the OpenAI path first; if the API is unavailable or fails, falls back to deterministic keyword-based routing so neither UI **ever goes fully offline**. |
| **Business Tools** (`src/tools/`) | 14 read-only analytics functions (balances, statements, insights, alerts, dashboard, etc.) plus their markdown formatters. Pure Python — no direct Odoo access. |
| **Data Provider** (`src/data/provider.py`) | Backend switch: `DATA_BACKEND=mock` (offline demo data) or `DATA_BACKEND=odoo` (live). Normalizes Odoo records into the same schema the tools already expect. |
| **Read-Only Gateway** (`src/services/odoo_service.py`) | The *only* module permitted to open an XML-RPC connection to Odoo. Every call is gated through the security layer before it runs. |
| **Odoo** | The ERP itself, reached only via `search` / `search_read` / `read`. |

---

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Streamlit prototype | SaaS stack |
|---|---|---|
| Language/Runtime | Python 3.11+ | Python 3.11+ (`apps/api`) · Node.js 20 / TypeScript (`apps/web`) |
| UI | Streamlit | Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19) |
| API layer | — (in-process call) | FastAPI |
| Auth | — (none) | Auth.js (NextAuth v5), credentials + JWT sessions |
| Persistence | — (none, stateless per session) | Prisma 7 + SQLite (`apps/web` conversation history only) |
| AI | OpenAI API (Function Calling), shared by both | |
| ERP Integration | Odoo XML-RPC, shared by both | |
| Data (dev/offline) | In-memory mock dataset, shared by both | |
| Export | CSV, Excel (openpyxl) | not yet ported to the SaaS stack |
| Local orchestration | `docker-compose.yml` | `docker-compose.saas.yml` |

No production database, message queue, or vector store for the business
logic itself in either stack — `apps/web`'s SQLite database is scoped
strictly to *who said what*, never Odoo/business data (see
[`docs/AUTH_AND_PERSISTENCE.md`](docs/AUTH_AND_PERSISTENCE.md)).

---

## Features

- **Natural-language querying** over live Odoo data via OpenAI function calling, with a deterministic offline fallback.
- **Customer Analytics** — balances, statements, lifetime value, purchase recency, risk level.
- **Product Analytics** — revenue, units sold, revenue share, exact-or-aggregated SKU matching.
- **Business Alerts** — proactive risk/opportunity detection (overdue customers, large invoices, inactive accounts, product concentration).
- **Collections Assistant** — prioritized follow-up list with a transparent scoring formula.
- **Executive Dashboard** — KPIs and top-5 charts in one view.
- **Natural-language date filters** — "this month", "last quarter", "between 2026-01-01 and 2026-03-31", etc.
- **Statement export** — CSV and Excel, generated on demand from the same data as the chat answer.
- **Conversational memory** — lightweight, text-only; ERP figures are always fetched fresh, never recalled from memory.

---

## Security Model

**The assistant is an ERP Analyst, not an ERP Operator.** It can read every
figure it's given access to; it cannot create, edit, delete, post, confirm,
reconcile, or validate anything in Odoo — even if the LLM hallucinates,
mis-selects a tool, or is prompt-injected.

Four independent layers enforce this, in order of authority:

1. **Dedicated Odoo user (primary)** — the agent authenticates as a
   purpose-built account (`AI_AGENT_READONLY`) whose Odoo ACLs grant `read`
   only, on a fixed list of models. Documented in
   [`docs/ODOO_READONLY_USER.md`](docs/ODOO_READONLY_USER.md).
2. **Code-level whitelist (secondary)** — `src/services/odoo_security.py`
   allows exactly `{search, search_read, read}` and rejects everything else
   (`create`, `write`, `unlink`, `action_post`, `reconcile`, …) with a
   `SecurityException`, regardless of what the ORM/gateway is asked to do.
3. **Startup validation (tertiary)** — the app refuses to start if
   `READ_ONLY_MODE` is off, credentials are missing, or the configured user
   isn't the dedicated read-only account.
4. **Audit logging (detection, not prevention)** — every Odoo call, allowed or
   blocked, is logged with timestamp, user, session ID, model, method, and
   decision.

Full threat model, attack vectors, and mitigations: [`SECURITY_REVIEW.md`](SECURITY_REVIEW.md).

---

## AI Workflow

1. The user asks a question in the Streamlit chat (or clicks a quick-question button).
2. The router sends the question — plus a lightweight, text-only conversation history — to OpenAI with the 14 available tool schemas.
3. OpenAI selects a tool and extracts arguments (e.g. a customer or product name, an optional time period).
4. The router executes that tool through the registry, which calls the read-only gateway.
5. The tool's own formatter renders the result as markdown (tables, currency, dates) — the model never invents figures; it only routes.
6. If OpenAI is unavailable, rate-limited, or errors, the router transparently falls back to deterministic keyword routing — same tools, same formatters, same answer.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- An OpenAI API key (optional — the app runs fully offline on mock data without one)
- An Odoo instance with XML-RPC enabled (optional — only needed for live mode)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZEYID-H/ODOO-AI-AGENT.git
cd ODOO-AI-AGENT

python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### Environment Variables

Set in `.env` (never commit this file — it's already in `.gitignore`):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | For AI routing | Enables OpenAI function calling. Without it, the app falls back to deterministic rule-based routing automatically. |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | No | Defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`. |
| `DATA_BACKEND` | No | `mock` (default, offline) or `odoo` (live, read-only). |
| `ODOO_URL` | For live mode | Base URL of your Odoo instance. |
| `ODOO_DB` | For live mode | Odoo database name. |
| `ODOO_USERNAME` | For live mode | Must be the dedicated read-only user, e.g. `AI_AGENT_READONLY`. |
| `ODOO_PASSWORD` | For live mode | API key (preferred) or password for that user. |
| `EXPECTED_ODOO_USER` | For live mode | Safety check — startup refuses to run if `ODOO_USERNAME` doesn't match this. |

### Running Locally

**Mock mode (no Odoo, no OpenAI key required):**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

**With OpenAI function calling (mock data, smarter routing):**

```bash
# Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in .env
streamlit run app.py
```

**Live Odoo mode:**

```bash
# Ensure ODOO_* vars are set in .env
DATA_BACKEND=odoo streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens at **http://localhost:8501**.

### Connecting to Odoo

1. Create a dedicated Odoo user (`AI_AGENT_READONLY`) with **read-only** access
   to the models listed in [`docs/ODOO_READONLY_USER.md`](docs/ODOO_READONLY_USER.md).
   This is the **primary** security control — do this before anything else.
2. Generate an API key for that user (Odoo → Account Security → New API Key).
3. Set `ODOO_URL`, `ODOO_DB`, `ODOO_USERNAME=AI_AGENT_READONLY`, `ODOO_PASSWORD`,
   `EXPECTED_ODOO_USER=AI_AGENT_READONLY`, and `DATA_BACKEND=odoo` in `.env`.
4. Verify the connection before opening the UI:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_odoo_connection.py
   ```
5. Run the security suite once more against your real setup:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_security.py
   ```

### SaaS Stack (Next.js + FastAPI)

A second, additive front end — a Next.js chat UI with login and persistent,
per-user conversation history — talks to the same `route_query()` through a
thin FastAPI wrapper (`apps/api`). It can run either via Docker Compose
(fastest way to try it) or as two local dev processes (faster iteration
when actively changing frontend/API code).

**Requirements:** everything the Streamlit path needs, plus Node.js 20+ (for
`apps/web`).

#### Option A — Docker Compose (recommended for trying it out)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.saas.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.saas.yml up
```

Web at http://localhost:3000, API at http://localhost:8000. Requires two
env files (both git-ignored): `.env` at the repo root (same variables as
the Streamlit path) and `apps/web/.env.docker` (copy from
`apps/web/.env.docker.example` — `AUTH_SECRET`, `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD`).
Full detail, architecture, and troubleshooting:
[`docs/DOCKER_SAAS_STACK.md`](docs/DOCKER_SAAS_STACK.md).

#### Option B — Local dev processes (for active development)

Terminal 1 — FastAPI backend, from the repo root:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-api.txt
uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload
```

Terminal 2 — Next.js frontend:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in AUTH_SECRET, APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD, API_AUTH_SECRET
npx prisma migrate dev             # creates apps/web/prisma/dev.db
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. `/` is a public landing page; `/dashboard`
requires signing in at `/login` (password from `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD`)
first.

#### SaaS stack environment variables

`apps/api` reads the same root `.env` as the Streamlit app (see
[Environment Variables](#environment-variables) above) — no separate
config. `apps/web` needs its own (`.env.local` for local dev,
`.env.docker` for Docker Compose — see
[`apps/web/.env.local.example`](apps/web/.env.local.example)):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` | Where the *browser* reaches the FastAPI backend. Default `http://localhost:8000`. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Signs the session JWT. Generate with `npx auth secret`. |
| `APP_ACCESS_PASSWORD` | The single shared login password. Unset → login always fails. |
| `API_AUTH_SECRET` | Signs the short-lived token `apps/web` uses to prove its identity to `apps/api` on every `/chat`/`/tools` call. **Must exactly match** the same variable in the root `.env` — it's one shared secret between the two services, not two independent ones. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite path for conversation history. `.env` (local dev) uses `file:./prisma/dev.db`; Docker Compose sets `file:/data/conversations.db` (a persistent volume) directly in `docker-compose.saas.yml`. |

Full detail: [`docs/AUTH_AND_PERSISTENCE.md`](docs/AUTH_AND_PERSISTENCE.md)
(user-facing login) and
[`docs/API_AUTHENTICATION.md`](docs/API_AUTHENTICATION.md) (the
`apps/web` ↔ `apps/api` trust boundary).

#### SaaS stack test/build/lint commands

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run lint     # ESLint
npm run build    # production build (also type-checks)
npm run test     # Vitest — unit + component tests, isolated test SQLite db

cd ../..          # repo root
python -m pytest apps/api/tests -v      # FastAPI layer
python -m py_compile apps/api/main.py   # syntax check
```

See [`docs/API_CONTRACT.md`](docs/API_CONTRACT.md) for the endpoints these
exercise.

## Testing

All test commands, in one place — every one of these is re-run before any
change to this project is committed.

**Core business logic** (mock-data integrity, read-only security
enforcement, date-filter parsing — shared by both front ends):
```bash
python tests/test_provider.py
python tests/test_security.py
python tests/test_date_filters.py
python test_routing.py            # end-to-end rule-based routing smoke test
```
Or, since these are also pytest-compatible:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Against a real Odoo connection** (manual, needs real credentials in `.env`):
```bash
python tests/test_odoo_connection.py
```

**FastAPI backend** (`apps/api`):
```bash
python -m pytest apps/api/tests -v
python -m py_compile app.py apps/api/main.py
```

**Next.js frontend** (`apps/web`):
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test
```

None of these require Docker or a live Odoo connection except
`test_odoo_connection.py` — the full suite runs offline against mock data.

## Known Limitations

- **Read-only by design** — the assistant cannot create, edit, or delete
  anything in Odoo. This is a deliberate security boundary, not a gap.
- **Depends on Odoo data quality** — categories, credit limits, and reference
  fields that aren't populated in Odoo won't appear in analytics (the tools
  degrade gracefully rather than erroring).
- **`credit_limit` may be unavailable** on some Odoo editions; the provider
  falls back to `0.0` when the field isn't exposed via XML-RPC.
- **Period statements have no opening balance** — a date-filtered customer
  statement's running balance starts at zero for that window, not the true
  historical balance; this is stated explicitly in the output.
- **Rule-based fallback has a smaller vocabulary** than the LLM path — a few
  ambiguous phrasings (e.g. "tell me about a product" vs "tell me about a
  customer") only resolve correctly via OpenAI function calling, not the
  offline fallback.
- **No multi-tenant / multi-currency handling** — currency is displayed as
  QAR; adapting to another base currency requires a small formatter change.

## Future Improvements

- Configurable analytics thresholds (currently constants in each tool module).
- Push-based alerting (scheduled `get_business_alerts` runs + notification).
- Multi-currency-aware formatting driven by the Odoo company record.
- Broader natural-language date coverage (fiscal-year-aware periods).
- Automated screenshot generation for documentation.

For the SaaS stack's own roadmap (real user accounts, production hosting,
rate limiting, and what should deliberately **not** be built yet), see
[`docs/NEXT_PHASES.md`](docs/NEXT_PHASES.md).

## Deployment

**Streamlit prototype** — Streamlit Community Cloud (recommended), Railway,
Render, Cloud Run, or a Docker+VPS setup. Full walkthrough, platform
comparison, and environment variables: [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md).

**SaaS stack (`apps/web` + `apps/api`)** — `docker-compose.saas.yml` is
**local development/testing tooling only**; it has not been deployed to a
public host. Production deployment (a real domain, TLS, secrets
management, and very likely a Postgres migration for `apps/web`'s
conversation database — the schema is already designed for that move) is
explicitly a future phase, not yet started. See
[`docs/DOCKER_SAAS_STACK.md`](docs/DOCKER_SAAS_STACK.md) for the current
local setup and [`docs/NEXT_PHASES.md`](docs/NEXT_PHASES.md) for the risks
to address before any public launch.

Neither deployment path changes `src/`, `route_query()`, or the read-only
Odoo security model — deployment is purely about how each UI is hosted and
reached, never about what the assistant is allowed to do.
